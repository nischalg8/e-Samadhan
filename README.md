# e-Samadhan
e-Samadhan is an e-governance platform that enables citizens to report local civic issues (water leakage, electricity outage, road damage, waste problems) by selecting a location, priority, photo, and description. An AI-assisted routing system automatically identifies the responsible government entity for action.
